My home project, an easy music player
A small music player. To demonstrate his work, there are 2 tracks (maybe more, with the addition to the list, I can also make a broadcast from the site, 
but I wanted to do so). 
The project is non-commercial and not educational, the idea and implementation are mine.
There was a break in the development process due to life circumstances, but I did it.
Screenshots of the application can be viewed in the "open it" folder.
